# Resume

## Explanation
- This is a project about designing my CV, using digital tools such as: NextJS, TailwindCSS, TypeScript, Icons, etc. This app has a vertical menu on the left side, where you set some personal information. The central content has data regarding my studies, my projects and relevant experience with the systems engineering career. Finally, on the right side links were established to some social networks where you can research more about the academic projects I have worked on.

## Start the project

- To run the project locally you can follow these steps:
  1) Clone the repository (git clone https://github.com/IngenieriaWeb-L-W/cristian-julio-mejia-portafolio.git)

  2) Update libraries and modules (If necessary)
     This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

  3) ## Getting Started

     First, run the development server:
     ```bash
     npm run dev
     or
     yarn dev
      or
     pnpm dev
     or
     bun dev```

4) Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
   You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
   This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
